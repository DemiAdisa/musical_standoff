# Musical Standoff

This is a cross platform mobile application written individually by me.
The idea and rules for this game were conceived during #HurricaneFiona. It is intended to have people challenge their musical knowledge and compete with people over the world.
Technologies used include Flutter (Frontend) and Firebase(Backend)

## Features
This application was intended to feature:
- A user authentication and login system
- Four different game modes: Single Player, Ranked, Multiplayer and Group Play
- A tutorial section for new beginners
- A local and global leaderboard
- Animations

## Status of the Project
Due to the nuances of setting up an application on both iOS and android devices (I do not own a Macbook) and the developer fees for the corresponding appstores, I have decided to convert this idea to a web application so everyone around the world can get it with no hassles.
Currently only one game mode was completed and that was the Group Play Mode
